		In the design team, this role is the only one touching the code.
	</p>
	<p>
		Specializations of front-end developers include CSS, HTML and the client side of JavaScript.
	</p>
	<p>
		The person in this role should create aspects of the solution that is user-oriented by using the code that is implemented in the browsers of the user.
	</p>
	<p>
		The skill set of a front-end developer changes all the time.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is due to the progress of browsers as well as mobile devices and the fact that the quality of the expectations of the user is continuously growing. When the web first started, a front-end developer only needed to be skilled in HTML; nowadays, they need to know JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, together with working with various frameworks and large codebases.
	</p>
	<p>
		Such changes will likely continue at an even faster pace in the future; as such, front-end developers require a strong desire to keep up to date with the latest developments in their fields as well as an eagerness to learn.
	</p>
	<p>
		The outputs of front-end developers are:
		<ul>
			<li>
				HTML code;
			</li>
			<li>
				JavaScript code;
			</li>
			<li>
				CSS architecture.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		If the company has an UX and development team, the technical UX designer will fill the cooperative role. Furthermore, depending on the needs of the project (i.e. big JavaScript applications and codebases), you should take note that the front-end developer role demands a structured approach and not just knowledge of JavaScript.
