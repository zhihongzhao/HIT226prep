		This role is a recent emergence in the UX space.
		</p>
		<p>
		Content strategy allows for usable content to be created, published and governed. 
		Something that is important to remember is that content does not only mean text; the stream of 
		what is called alternative media and content channels, like social, 
		only highlights the necessity to have this content strategist role on the design team.
		</p>
		<p>
		On most teams, this role also includes that of the information architect and search
		engine optimization (SEO).
		</p>
		<p>
		Typical outputs from the content strategist are:
		<ul>
			<li>An editorial calendar;</li>
			<li>An editorial process and governance;</li>
			<li>A guide on the contentâ€™s tone of voice;</li>
			<li>Evaluation of the content and an audit thereof;</li>
			<li>Writing templates;</li>
			<li>Evaluation of the content, including policies, information architecture and taxonomies;</li>
			<li>The content itself and strategy.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			In projects where SEO is of prime concern, 
			that content strategist will have to implement the SEO plan.
		</p>
		<p>
			This role, also, is sometimes separate from the user experience team as it deals with guiding and commanding an editorial team. 
			It is important to note that content creation leads to the success of a website, either as an equal aspect to or a more important one than visual design and interaction.
		</p>
		<p>
			The background of people in this role will be an editorial department, where the person was part of the editorial team on a content-heavy website,
			publishing or media.
		</p>
		<p>
			The role will also face changes in the future, and the content strategic would need to be even more skilled in content other than copy. There are more content channels being created, too, so the Internet of Things (IoT), amongst others, 
			brings with it the demand to create and manage content that can be used across various types of channels.
		</p>
		<p>
			One thing is important to remember: a content strategist and a content producer is not one and the same; a content strategist is rather someone who facilitates the production of content and this requires autonomy,
			which will lead to success.
