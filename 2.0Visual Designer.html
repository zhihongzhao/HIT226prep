		This role is very important in order to build the best design team.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also called graphic designers, visual designers are responsible for choosing and 
		ordering elements, like images, colors, symbols and typography, 
		to express a message to people.
	</p>
	<p>
		Over the past few years, with the advancement of mobile design,
		increased browser capabilities and responsive design, 
		the visual designer role has changed.
	</p>
	<p>
		An absolute must is that 
		these designers are creative and able to create solutions.
	</p>
	<p>
		A graphic designer these days has to create visual components and s
		ystems that, together, are dynamic in nature. This has caused the gap 
		between the multifaceted designer, who is able to work on screen and print,
		and a designer who is specialist in nature — they work on mobile or web designs and are well acquainted with visual design that is interactive for the user.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lately, there has also been a development in which these designers undertake a front-end developer role; however, this happens mostly when the interaction
		on the project isn’t heavy and where JavaScript is less important than cascading style sheets (CSS).
	</p>
	<p>
		The most common outputs from the visual or graphic designer are:
		<ul>
			<li>Design composition and rules;</li>
			<li>Grid systems;</li>
			<li>Iconography;</li>
			<li>Style guides and tiles;</li>
			<li>Mood boards;</li>
			<li>Typography.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		It is key to recruit visual designers that have a strong interaction focus; 
		whether they are self-taught or studied design.
	</p>
	<p>
		Moreover, the person who fulfills this role needs to be able to work with the tools and methods that are utilized in the execution of front-end developers, 
		particularly when responsive techniques and CSS3 are involved.
	</p>
	<p>
		Graphic designers need to be more than capable to design systems on screens that are static. 
		For example dealing with microinteraction will be a key skill to have.
