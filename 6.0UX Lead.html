		As the role name suggests, the experience lead supplies that leadership aspect that the design team needs.
	</p>
	<p>
		The team needs a dedicated leader who can ensure that the team moves in the right direction.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unlike all the other roles, this one has no direct outputs other than the end product. In order to succeed in the vision of the project and get to the end result, the experience lead role may require a lot of communication with the team, facilitation and even decision making.
	</p>
	<p>
		The experience lead should have enough skills and experience in order to fill the other roles as well (or some of them), so the person would not be solely responsible for leading the team.
	</p>
	<p>
		One skill is very important to have: a good predisposition for business, as it is the spokesperson for the team in relation to the teamâ€™s relationship with the leaders of the company. Mentoring is another nice to have skill.
	</p>
	<p>
		Furthermore, the line becomes obscured between user and customer experience with regard to the experience lead.
